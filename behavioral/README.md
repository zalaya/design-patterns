# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. They are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

## Patterns

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Decouples sender and receiver of a request based on type of request.
2. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
3. **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language.
4. **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes.
5. **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state.
6. **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
7. **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
8. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
9. **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
10. **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes on which it operates.
