# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

## Patterns

1. **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
2. **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3. **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
4. **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
5. **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
6. **Flyweight**: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
7. **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
