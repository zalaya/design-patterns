# Design Patterns in Java

This repository provides examples of design patterns implemented in Java. The patterns are categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each category has its own dedicated README that provides a brief overview and examples of the patterns.

## Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. [Read more](./creational/README.md)

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. They are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. [Read more](./structural/README.md)

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. They are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. [Read more](./behavioral/README.md)
