# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Factory**: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
5. **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
6. **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning an existing object.
